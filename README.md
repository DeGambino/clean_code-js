# Clean-Code-Handbook
This repository summarizes the key ideas and principles from "Clean Code in JavaScript" by James Padolsey, offering a quick reference without rereading the entire book.

## Section 1: What is Clean Code Anyway?

### Chapter 1: Setting the Scene

<details> 
  <summary>What is Clean Code?</summary>
  
- Clean code is simple, clear, and maintainable.

- It prioritizes readability for humans over machines.

  <summary>What is the Problem?</summary>
  
   Understanding the user's needs is crucial in programming. To effectively address a problem, we must ask key questions:
  
  - What problem is the user encountering?
  - How do they currently carry out this task?
  - What existing solutions are there and how do they work?
  
  By thoroughly understanding the problem, we can ideate, plan, and write code that effectively resolves it. Our perception of the problem shapes the model we create, which ultimately influences the solution we develop.

  <summary>Meaningful abstractions</summary>
  
- Abstraction simplifies complexity by presenting it in a more understandable form. In coding, abstractions allow us to manage complexity without needing to grasp all underlying details. The key is that every line of code involves using, creating, or communicating abstractions.

  <summary>The Tower of Abstraction</summary>
  
- The tower of abstraction represents the layers of complexity in technology, from hardware at the base to high-level interfaces at the top. Each layer abstracts complexity for the layer above. When writing code, we're adding to this tower, with users either being other developers or end-users who interact with the simplified interfaces we've built.

  <summary>Key Principles</summary>
- Code should be readable, understandable, and maintainable.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and always aim for simplicity in structure and logic.
